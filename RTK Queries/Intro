Alright, letâ€™s break RTK Query (Redux Toolkit Query) down into simple terms that even a beginner can understand! ðŸŒŸ

What is RTK Query?
RTK Query is a tool that comes with Redux Toolkit to help you fetch data from APIs easily and manage it efficiently in your React app.

When you fetch data from APIs, you usually need to:

1 Send an API request.
2 Handle loading, success, and error states.
3 Save the data somewhere ( redux / gloal state) so the app can use it.
4 Refetch data when necessary, like when it gets stale.
5 RTK Query does all this for you automatically! ðŸŽ‰


                                   How Does RTK Query Work?
Hereâ€™s a simplified process:

1 Define Your API: You tell RTK Query about your API endpoints (e.g., GET /movies, POST /users).
2 Auto-Generated Hooks: RTK Query creates ready-to-use React hooks (e.g., useGetMoviesQuery) that you can use in your components.
3 Magic Happens:
    It fetches data.
    It caches the data so you donâ€™t fetch it again unnecessarily.
    It tracks the loading, success, and error states automatically.
    It updates your UI when the data changes.
