// fucntion callback in js 
a function is passsed as argument into another fucntion

function greet(name, callback) {                   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<,, NOTICE this 
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  callback();
}

function sayGoodbye() {
  console.log("Goodbye!");
}

// Passing sayGoodbye as a callback
greet("Alice", sayGoodbye);

allbacks were traditionally used for asynchronous operations, but they can lead to callback hell if nested too deeply. 
To overcome this, Promises and async/await were introduced for better readability and error handling
