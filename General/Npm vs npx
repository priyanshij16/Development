NPM is a package management that is used to install, uninstall, and update Javascript packages on your workstation,

Purpose: Used to execute a package without globally installing it.
Temporary Execution: Downloads and executes a package temporarily, and then deletes it after use.

Which is Better for CRA Deployment?
Use NPM if:

    The package/tool is part of your development workflow and is used frequently.
    You want to ensure consistent behavior across environments (other developers or CI/CD systems).
    Example: Adding a deployment script in package.json:
    json
    Copy code
    "scripts": {
      "deploy": "firebase deploy"
    }
Use NPX if:

    You only need the tool for deployment once or infrequently.
    You prefer not to install a package globally or in your project dependencies.
