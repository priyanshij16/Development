Ep1 Load Js Asynchronously | Network Optimization ||:

when JS is after a BODY tag:

1.HTML parsing: <html> 
<head> 
  <title> 
    <body> then comes 
      <srcipt src='script.js></scriot>
</html>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.
using async 
<srcipt async src="Srcipt.js"/>

it doesn't paused HTML parsing as it shouldn't paused.

------------------------------------------------------
 3		DEFER  

<srcipt defer src="Srcipt.js"/>

After HTML parsing , the code will be executed ,
so prefetching the Js like downloading .

In first method we are making network call after the parsing but in 
defer case we are pre fetching it 

By defer attribute we can pre fetch the JSc code before html parsing , and when parsing phase complted we can run Js code .

-------------------------------------------------------------
difference b/w asycn and defer :
1. EXECUTION Part:
 ASYNC: it's basically blocks the parsing during execution
 DEFER: it does not block 
 
 Why defer is better than async?
