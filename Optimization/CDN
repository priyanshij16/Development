What is cdn?
 A CDN, or Content Delivery Network, is a system of distributed servers that delivers web content 
(like images, stylesheets, scripts and other resources) to users, reliably and efficiently.

                                                      How does a CDN work?
 
A CDNâ€™s primary function is to cache and serve both static and dynamic web content to users. It achieves this by using the following:

Origin Server: This is the main server where all content is originally hosted.

Edge Servers: These are servers distributed in different geographical locations to serve web content to users closer to them.

Caching: This is a way of storing content on edge servers to reduce repeated requests to the origin server.

DNS Routing: This is the mechanism that reroutes users to the nearest edge servers based on their location.

This is what happens when a user clicks on a CDN link:

1. rqst hit on main server.
2. server sends back response also sends copy to nearest server located geographically closet to user.
3. The edge server caches the copy.
4. When the user wants to access the resources again, the edge server (not the origin server) sends over the cached copy.
