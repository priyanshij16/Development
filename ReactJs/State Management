How React Handles State Management?

React provides multiple ways to manage state, depending on the complexity and scope of the application. 
The main state management techniques include:

                                                 Local State (Component-level)

Managed using useState or useReducer.
Example: Form inputs, UI toggles.
                                                Global State (Across components)

Managed using Context API or external state management libraries like Redux/RTK Query.
Example: User authentication, themes.

                                                Server State (Data fetched from APIs)
Managed using RTK Query, React Query, or custom API calls.
Example: API responses, caching.
URL State

Managed using React Router.
Example: Query parameters, pagination.
