1. Performance
CRA:

-> Relies on Webpack for bundling, which can be slower, especially for larger projects.
-> Development server startup times are longer because Webpack builds the entire app upfront.
-> Suitable for small to medium-sized apps but can struggle with larger ones.

Vite:

-> Uses ESBuild for dependency pre-bundling, which is extremely fast.
-> Provides near-instant startup, even for large projects, by using a module-based dev server (native ESM support).
-> Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is significantly faster, making it ideal for rapid development.

2 Build Speed
CRA:

Slower build times due to Webpackâ€™s processing.
Not ideal for CI/CD pipelines where quick builds are essential.
Vite:

Faster builds due to ESBuild and efficient module graph handling.
Better suited for modern workflows and pipelines.
